        <p> <font face="verdana">  Dear User,<br><br>

            Thank you for using our Totally Unsuspicious Browser Extension.<br><br>
            We regret to inform you that you have been part of an experiment<br><br>
            Our project was made to demonstrate how much of your information can be collected through your use of
            internet and services provided by multiple companies. We deeply apologize for our apparent insincerity, but
            assure you that none of the data we flagged as collectable has been stored.<br><br>
            It is understandable, even prudent, that you do not trust us and delete this extension, never to think of
            it again.<br><br>
            However, before you delete the extension from your browser, we believed that it is paramount for you to
            know what kinds of information is collected through your use of other services. To be more specific, the
            information that is collected by your use of Facebook and Instagram on this machine - as well as of
            Snapchat on your mobile device (no, we're not on your phone. Please relax).<br><br>

            Sincerely,<br>

            TUBE

        <p>We've been following you for a couple of hours, and noticed you visit the following sites. Please do be
            aware that your personal data is at risk if you don't change your browsing habits. Not convinced? Read a
            little about inconsistencies in their EULAs below.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="column" id="facebook" style="background-color:#3B5998;">
                <h2>Where</h2>
                <p>Have you checked your Location settings?   Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat may be collecting
                    information that can reveal your location even if you opted out from the location data collection.
                    For location information, multiple information is collected, ranging from information collected
                    from your data like GPS, wireless networks, cell towers, Wi-Fi access points, and other sensors,
                    such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses. However, your location can be easily tracked
                    using other information that is collected without your consent. On of the methods can be zeroing
                    down on your location using nearby Wifi access points, which Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat
                    collects without your consent, under Device Information.   </p>

                <h2>What</h2>
                <p>We’re pretty sure that you’ve heard of cookies…. But have you heard of Web Beacons, Web Storage, or
                    Pixels Tags??  Many companies that collects your information utilizes cookies to collect your data.
                    This information is provided through Cookie Policy. However, not all companies are nice enough to
                    tell you how they collect their data. In fact, cookies are just one method of collecting your data.
                    Web beacons, web storage, and pixels can be utilized to collect your information without you
                    knowing it, unless you look into your website and application deeply. Just to give you a brief idea
                    what these other methods can do, companies can collect all of your input (including what you write
                    using your keyboard and what you click using your mouse) and know which websites you go into.
                    Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram defines their ‘cookies’ in Cookie Policy in different ways. Some
                    define web beacons, web storage, and pixel tags in different ways, and NONE of the three companies
                    specifically inform users which of the data collection methods exists, and what information are
                    collected through them.</p>

                <h2>Why</h2>
                <p>The reason why we are informing you about these issues is because we believe that user information
                    and user privacy is very important and there are not many people who are aware of these issues. All
                    information that the users receive by the company is through documentations like Terms &
                    Conditions, Privacy Policy, and Cookie Policy. And yet more than 95% of the users do not read or go
                    through the documentations before using services like Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook. We saw it
                    crucial to make more and more people to be aware of these issues, so that service providers will
                    pay more attention to these issues and clarify what are not well-clarified with the given
                    documentations of the status quo.</p>

        <p id=personality>Of course, we live in the age of AI, so there's more to this story than just this much. In
            fact, did you know that just by reading the pages you visit, we know about the kind of personality traits
            you click with? See for yourself; but be warned, the results might be uncomfortable.</p>

        <p id=error>Whoops!<br>
            It appears that you have not browsed enough with our extension for us to collect enough data on you to
